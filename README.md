#uni projects

This repository contains a collection of academic and personal projects developed throughout my studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at West University of Timisoara. The projects span multiple programming languages and areas such as algorithms, data structures, desktop applications, C++ text indexing, and Android app development for educational purposes. Some of them are not finished yet.

## ðŸ“Š Grand Prix of Sorting Algorithms â€“ Race Against Time

This project is both theoretical and practical. I analyzed the time complexities of five popular sorting algorithms and compared the theoretical expectations with real-world execution times on various data sets. The goal was to deepen my understanding of algorithmic performance in different scenarios (best case, average case, worst case) by implementing and testing each sorting method in a controlled environment.

## ðŸŒ³ Text Indexing Using a B-Tree (C++)

In this C++ project, I developed a program that reads a full book from a `.txt` file and indexes every word using a B-tree. The tree stores each word along with the positions where it appears in the file. This structure significantly improves search efficiency and mimics how indexing works in databases or text editors.
